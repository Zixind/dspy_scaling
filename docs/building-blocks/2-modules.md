# Modules

A **DSPy module** is a building block for programs that use LMs.

- Each built-in module abstracts a **prompting technique** (like chain of thought or ReAct). Crucially, they are generalized to handle any [DSPy Signature]().

- A DSPy module has **learnable parameters** (i.e., the little pieces comprising the prompt and the LM weights) and can be invoked (called) to process inputs and return outputs.

- Multiple modules can be composed into bigger modules (programs). DSPy modules are inspired directly by NN modules in PyTorch, but applied to LM programs.


## How do I use a built-in module, like `dspy.Predict` or `dspy.ChainOfThought`?

Let's start with the most fundamental module, `dspy.Predict`. Internally, all other DSPy modules are just built using `dspy.Predict`.

We'll assume you are already at least a little familiar with [DSPy signatures], which are declarative specs for defining the behavior of any module we use in DSPy.

To use a module, we first **declare** it by giving it a signature. Then we **call** the module with the input arguments, and extract the output fields!

```python
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.

# 1) Declare with a signature.
classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment')

# 2) Call with input argument(s). 
response = classify(sentence=sentence)

# 3) Access the output.
print(response.sentiment)
```
**Output:**
```text
Positive
```
